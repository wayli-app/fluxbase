## Quick Start

```bash
# Pull and run with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/wayli-app/fluxbase:latest

# Or use Docker Compose for production
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wayli-app/fluxbase/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then connect with the TypeScript SDK:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@fluxbase/sdk";

const client = createClient("http://localhost:8080", "your-api-key");

// Query data
const { data, error } = await client.from("posts").select("*");

// Subscribe to changes
client
  .channel("posts")
  .on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", table: "posts" }, (payload) => {
    console.log("Change:", payload);
  })
  .subscribe();
```
