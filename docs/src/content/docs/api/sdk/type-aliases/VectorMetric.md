> **VectorMetric**: `"l2"` \| `"cosine"` \| `"inner_product"`

Vector distance metric for similarity search
- l2: Euclidean distance (L2 norm) - lower is more similar
- cosine: Cosine distance - lower is more similar (1 - cosine similarity)
- inner_product: Negative inner product - lower is more similar
