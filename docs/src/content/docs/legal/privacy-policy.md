This privacy policy explains how Fluxbase handles data when you use our software and services.

## Documentation Website

### Analytics

This documentation website uses [Umami](https://umami.is/), a privacy-focused analytics tool, to understand how visitors use the site. Umami:

- Does not use cookies
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not track users across websites
- Complies with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR

We collect anonymous usage statistics such as page views, referrer sources, and browser types to improve the documentation.

## Admin Dashboard

When you use the Fluxbase Admin Dashboard, we store the following data in your browser's local storage:

### Authentication Data

- **Access and refresh tokens** to keep you signed in
- **Your user profile** (email, name, avatar URL) to personalize the interface

### Session Data

- **Impersonation session details** when administrators use the user impersonation feature

### Application Preferences

- **API request history** and saved requests in the REST API explorer (up to 50 entries)

### Why We Store This Data

This data is stored locally on your device to:

- Maintain your authenticated session without requiring repeated logins
- Provide a seamless experience across page navigation
- Remember your saved API requests for development convenience

We do not use local storage for advertising, analytics, or cross-site tracking purposes.

### Data Retention

Locally stored data persists until:

- You sign out (authentication data is cleared automatically)
- You clear your browser's local storage manually
- You clear the API history using the in-app controls

### Your Control

You can clear all locally stored Fluxbase data at any time by:

1. Signing out of the Admin Dashboard
2. Clearing your browser's local storage for this domain
3. Using your browser's "Clear site data" feature

## Self-Hosted Deployments

When you self-host Fluxbase, you are the data controller for all data stored in your deployment. Fluxbase (the software) does not send telemetry, analytics, or any data to external servers unless you explicitly configure integrations.
