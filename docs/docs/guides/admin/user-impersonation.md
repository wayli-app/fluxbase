# User Impersonation

User impersonation allows admins to view the database explorer as different user types to debug issues, test Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and provide customer support.

## Overview

The impersonation feature enables admins to see exactly what data users can query based on their RLS policies. This is invaluable for:

- üêõ **Debugging user-reported issues** - See data exactly as the user sees it
- üîí **Testing RLS policies** - Verify security rules work correctly
- üéØ **Customer support** - Understand what users are experiencing
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Testing different roles** - Validate permissions for anon and service roles

## Impersonation Modes

### 1. Specific User

Impersonate a real user by their ID to see data exactly as they would see it.

**Use cases:**
- Debugging user-reported data issues
- Verifying RLS policies for specific users
- Customer support investigations

**How it works:**
- Respects all RLS policies for that user
- Uses the user's actual permissions
- All queries execute in their security context

### 2. Anonymous (anon key)

See data as an unauthenticated visitor would see it.

**Use cases:**
- Testing public data access
- Verifying anon-level RLS policies
- Ensuring sensitive data is protected from public access

**How it works:**
- Generates a temporary JWT with `role: "anon"`
- No user account required
- Only public data should be accessible

### 3. Service Role

View data with service-level permissions.

**Use cases:**
- Administrative queries
- Testing privileged operations
- Bypassing RLS for data management

**How it works:**
- Generates a JWT with `role: "service"`
- May bypass RLS (depending on configuration)
- Elevated permissions for admin tasks

## Usage

### Starting Impersonation

1. Navigate to the **Tables** page in the admin dashboard
2. Click the **"Impersonate User"** button in the header
3. Select your impersonation type:
   - **Specific User** - Search and select a user by email
   - **Anonymous** - Impersonate as unauthenticated user
   - **Service Role** - Use service-level permissions
4. Enter a **reason** (required for audit trail)
   - Example: "Support ticket #1234"
   - Example: "Testing RLS policy for premium users"
5. Click **"Start Impersonation"**
6. The page reloads with impersonation active
7. An **orange warning banner** appears showing who you're impersonating

### While Impersonating

When impersonation is active:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orange banner displays at the top of the screen
- All table queries use the impersonated user's permissions
- Data grid shows only rows the impersonated user can access
- Edit/delete operations respect RLS policies
- You cannot start another impersonation (must stop first)

### Stopping Impersonation

1. Click **"Stop Impersonation"** in the warning banner
2. Session ends in the database
3. Impersonation tokens are cleared
4. Page reloads with admin context restored

## How It Works

### Two-Token Architecture

The system maintains two separate JWT tokens:

```typescript
// In localStorage
fluxbase_admin_access_token      // Your admin token
fluxbase_admin_user              // Your admin user info
fluxbase_impersonation_token     // Target user's token (when active)
fluxbase_impersonated_user       // Target user info
fluxbase_impersonation_session   // Session metadata
```

### Token Selection

All API requests automatically use the appropriate token:

```typescript
const getActiveToken = () => {
  const impToken = localStorage.getItem('fluxbase_impersonation_token')
  const adminToken = localStorage.getItem('fluxbase_admin_access_token')
  return impToken || adminToken  // Impersonation takes precedence
}
```

### RLS Integration

When querying data while impersonating:

1. **Frontend** sends request with impersonation token
2. **API Client** adds token to Authorization header
3. **Auth Middleware** extracts user ID and role from JWT
4. **RLS Middleware** sets PostgreSQL session variables:
   ```sql
   SET LOCAL app.user_id = '<impersonated_user_id>'
   SET LOCAL app.role = '<impersonated_role>'
   ```
5. **Database** enforces RLS policies based on these variables
6. **Results** show only data the impersonated user can access

## Security Features

### Audit Trail

Every impersonation session is logged in the `auth.impersonation_sessions` table:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `admin_user_id` | Who performed the impersonation |
| `target_user_id` | Which user was impersonated (nullable for anon/service) |
| `impersonation_type` | Type: 'user', 'anon', or 'service' |
| `target_role` | Role being impersonated |
| `reason` | Why the impersonation occurred |
| `started_at` | When it started |
| `ended_at` | When it ended |
| `ip_address` | IP address of the admin |
| `user_agent` | Browser/client information |
| `is_active` | Whether session is currently active |

### Access Control

- ‚úÖ Only users with `role = 'admin'` can impersonate
- ‚úÖ Self-impersonation is prevented (for user mode)
- ‚úÖ Reason field is required (cannot be empty)
- ‚úÖ Only one active session per admin at a time
- ‚úÖ Previous session auto-ends when starting new one

### Visual Indicators

- üü† Bright orange warning banner (cannot be dismissed)
- üìù Shows impersonation type and target user
- üîí Impersonate button disabled while already impersonating

```

## Troubleshooting

### Impersonation token not working

**Symptoms:** Queries return admin data instead of impersonated user's data

**Solutions:**
- Check localStorage for `fluxbase_impersonation_token`
- Verify token is being sent in Authorization header
- Check backend logs for JWT validation errors
- Ensure you reloaded the page after starting impersonation

### Data not filtered correctly

**Symptoms:** Seeing more/less data than expected

**Solutions:**
- Verify RLS policies exist on the tables
- Check PostgreSQL session variables: `SHOW app.user_id`
- Ensure RLS middleware is enabled in backend config
- Verify the RLS policies use `app.user_id` and `app.role` correctly

### Cannot stop impersonation

**Symptoms:** Stop button doesn't work or session persists

**Solutions:**
- Clear localStorage manually via browser DevTools
- Check for active session in `auth.impersonation_sessions` table
- Verify DELETE endpoint is accessible (check CORS/network)
- Logout and login again to reset session

### Users not appearing in search

**Symptoms:** User search returns no results

**Solutions:**
- Verify `exclude_admins` filter isn't hiding all users
- Check user has non-admin role in database
- Ensure user exists and is not deleted
- Try searching with full email address

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Provide a Clear Reason

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
reason: "Support ticket #12345 - user reports missing data"

// ‚ùå Bad
reason: "testing"
```

### 2. Stop Impersonation When Done

Don't leave impersonation sessions running. Always click "Stop Impersonation" when finished to:
- Clear audit trail properly
- Avoid confusion
- Prevent accidental data modifications

### 3. Review Audit Logs Regularly

Query the impersonation sessions table to monitor usage:

```sql
SELECT
  admin_user_id,
  target_user_id,
  impersonation_type,
  reason,
  started_at,
  ended_at,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ended_at - started_at)) as duration_seconds
FROM auth.impersonation_sessions
WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY started_at DESC;
```

### 4. Test RLS Policies with Multiple Scenarios

Use all three impersonation modes to thoroughly test:
- **User mode**: Test with regular users
- **Anon mode**: Verify public data access
- **Service mode**: Test admin operations
