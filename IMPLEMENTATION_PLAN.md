### **SPRINT 9: Edge Functions (Deno Runtime)** (Week 9)

**Goal**: JavaScript/TypeScript serverless functions with Deno

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Key differentiator
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started (0% complete)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **WebSocket scaling** - Mitigation: Connection pooling, load testing
2. **File storage limits** - Mitigation: Streaming uploads, chunking
3. **Query performance** - Mitigation: Query analysis, indexes
4. **Binary size** - Mitigation: Build optimization, lazy loading

### Scope Risks

1. **Feature creep** - Mitigation: Strict sprint goals
2. **Over-engineering** - Mitigation: MVP-first approach
3. **Testing debt** - Mitigation: Test-first development

---

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

### Start Here

1. Read `.claude/project.md` for context
2. Check this file for current sprint
3. Begin with Sprint 1, Task 1: JWT utilities

### Remember

- Test-first development
- Update TODO.md with progress
- Keep binary size under 50MB
- Maintain PostgREST compatibility
- Document as you build

### Context for Claude

You're building a production-ready BaaS. The foundation is rock-solid. Now it's time to implement the business logic that makes it useful. Start with authentication since it blocks everything else.
