# DevContainer Changelog

## 2024-10-26 - Fixed and Enhanced

### üêõ Fixes
1. **Build Context Issue**: Changed build context from `.devcontainer` to parent directory (`..`)
   - Fixed: `context: ..` in docker-compose.yml
   - Fixed: `dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile`

2. **Database Initialization**: Simplified PostgreSQL setup
   - Removed POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES hack
   - Created databases properly in init-db.sql
   - Added PostgreSQL extensions (uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, btree_gin)

3. **Removed Features**: Removed devcontainer features that were causing issues
   - Features are now installed directly in Dockerfile for better control
   - More reliable and predictable builds

4. **Post-Create Script**: Created comprehensive setup script
   - Waits for PostgreSQL to be ready
   - Creates test database
   - Installs Go tools
   - Runs migrations
   - Configures SQLTools

### üéØ Next Steps

1. Test the devcontainer: Open in VS Code
2. Verify all services start
3. Run `make test` to verify build
4. Start implementing Sprint 1 (Authentication)
5. Use Claude Code for AI-powered development

### üêõ Known Issues

None at this time. If you encounter issues, check the Troubleshooting section in README.md.

### üí° Tips

1. Use `F1` ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container" if things break
2. Check Docker Desktop is running and has enough resources
3. First build is slow; subsequent starts are fast
4. All data persists in Docker volumes
5. Use `make help` to see all available commands
